# hello-world

I'm Christina!

I hail from the great state of Alaska.
My Boston Terrier is 9 years young and her name is Bella (not like the chick from Twilight, think more Bellatrix Lastrange)

I live in San Francisco and love the great outdoors - parks, camping, hiking, paddle-boating, etc.

Nice to meet you!
